# Hands-free manipulation of medical images using a depth camera

- Course: Fundamentals of Medical Imaging, Fall 2014
- Instructor: Dr. Nikolaos V. Tsekos

## Abstract

The use of medical images in a surgical environment requires using computer
interfaces, however these are difficult to keep sterile when the surgeon is in
direct contact with the input devices. We propose that the recent availability
of cheap sensors for 3D pose estimation can be used provide a hands-free
interface for manipulating medical images in 3D.
